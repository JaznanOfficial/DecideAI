don't write too much code (above 300 lins) in a single file. always use reusable small components.
handle error perfectly, so for any kind of error server or project will not crash or down.
use bun always, never use npm/yarn/pnpm or nay kind of other package manager.
use sonner from shadcn for any kind of error and success handling.
in this project, we'll use next.js (latest 16 version), shadcn, better auth, vercel's ai sdk, react-query (tanstack query) etc.
always follow the same structure for same kind of operations. like when fetching data always use tanstack query for fetching don't use anything else for data fetching.
